[[installation]]
== Installing Maven

The process of installing Apache Maven is very simple. This chapter
covers it in detail. Your only prerequisite is an installed Java
Development Kit (JDK). If you are just interested in installation, you
can move on to the rest of the book after reading through
<<installation-sect-maven-download>> and
<<installation-sect-maven-install>>. If you are interested in the
details of your Maven installation, this entire chapter will give you
an overview of what you've installed and the meaning of the Apache
Software License, Version 2.0.

[[installation-sect-java]]
=== Verify your Java Installation

The latest version of Maven currently requires the usage of Java 7 or
higher. While older Maven versions can run on older Java versions, this book
assumes that you are running at least Java 7. Go with the most recent
stable Java Development Kit (JDK) available for your operating system.

----
% java -version
java version "1.7.0_71"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_71-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.71-b01, mixed mode)
----

TIP: More details about Java version required for different Maven
versions can be found http://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html[on the Maven site].

Maven works with all certified Javaâ„¢ compatible development kits,
and a few non-certified implementations of Java. The examples in this
book were written and tested against the official Java Development Kit
releases downloaded from the Oracle web site. 


[[installation-sect-maven-download]]
=== Downloading Maven

You can download Apache Maven from the project website at
http://maven.apache.org/download.html[http://maven.apache.org/download.html].

When downloading Maven, make sure you choose the latest version of
Apache Maven from the Maven website. The latest version of Maven when
this book was written was Maven 3.3.3. If you are not familiar with
the Apache Software License, you should familiarize yourself with the
terms of the license before you start using the product. More
information on the Apache Software License can be found in
<<installation-sect-license>>.

[[installation-sect-maven-install]]
=== Installing Maven

There are wide differences between operating systems such as Mac OS X
and Microsoft Windows, and there are subtle differences between
different versions of Windows. Luckily, the process of installing
Maven on all of these operating systems is relatively painless and
straightforward. The following sections outline the recommended
best-practice for installing Maven on a variety of operating systems.

[[installation-sect-maven-nix]]
==== Installing Maven on Linux, BSD and Mac OS X

Download the current release of Maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.html[]. 
Choose a format that is convenient for you to work
with. Pick an appropriate place for it to live, and expand the archive
there. If you expanded the archive into the directory
`/usr/local/apache-maven-3.0.5`, you may want to create a symbolic
link to make it easier to work with and to avoid the need to change
any environment configuration when you upgrade to a newer version:

----
/usr/local % cd /usr/local
/usr/local % ln -s apache-maven-3.0.5 maven
/usr/local % export PATH=/usr/local/maven/bin:$PATH
----

Once Maven is installed, you need to add its `bin` directory in the
distribution (in this example, `/usr/local/maven/bin`) to your command
path. 

You'll need to add the +PATH+ configuration to a script that will run
every time you login. To do this, add the following lines to
`.bash_login` or `.profile`.

----
export PATH=/usr/local/maven/bin:${PATH}
----

Once you've added these lines to your own environment, you will be
able to run Maven from the command line.

NOTE: These installation instructions assume that you are running
bash.

[[installation-sect-windows]]
==== Installing Maven on Microsoft Windows

Installing Maven on Windows is very similar to installing Maven on Mac
OS X, the main differences being the installation location and the
setting of an environment variable. This book assumes a Maven
installation directory of `C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.0.5`, but
it won't make a difference if you install Maven in another directory
as long as you configure the proper environment variable. Once you've
unpacked Maven to the installation directory, you will need to update
the `PATH` environment variable:

----
C:\Users\tobrien > set PATH="c:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.0.5\bin";%PATH%
----

Setting this environment variable on the command line will allow you
to run Maven in your current session. Unless you add them to the
System or User environment variables through the Control Panel, you'll have to
execute these two lines every time you log into your system. You
should modify both of these variables through the Control Panel in
Microsoft Windows.

[[installation-sect-set-env-var]]
===== Setting Environment Variables
* Go into the +Control Panel+
* Select +System+
* Go in +Advanced+ tab and click on +Environment Variables+.
* Click on the Path variable in the lower System variables section and click
the Edit button.  
* Add the string +"C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.0.5\bin;"+ in the Variable value field to the
front of the existing value and click on the OK button in this and the
following dialogs.

[[installation-sect-test-install]]
=== Testing a Maven Installation

Once Maven is installed, you can check the version by running +mvn -v+
from the command line. If Maven has been installed, you should see
something resembling the following output.

----
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.0.5 (r01de14724cdef164cd33c7c8c2fe155faf9602da; 2013-02-19 05:51:28-0800)
Maven home: /usr/local/maven
Java version: 1.7.0_75, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_75.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.8.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
----

If you see this output, you know that Maven is available and ready to
be used. If you do not see this output, and your operating system
cannot find the +mvn+ command, make sure that your +PATH+ environment
variable and +M2_HOME+ environment variable have been properly set.

[[installation-sect-details]]
=== Maven Installation Details

Maven's download measures in at a few megabyte only. It has attained such
a slim download size because the core of Maven has been designed to
retrieve plugins and dependencies from a remote repository
on-demand. When you start using Maven, it will start to download
plugins to a local repository described in
<<installation-sect-user>>. In case you are curious, let's take a
quick look at what is in Maven's installation directory.

----
/usr/local/maven $ ls -p1
LICENSE.txt
NOTICE
README.txt
bin/
boot/
conf/
lib/
----

`LICENSE.txt` contains the software license for Apache Maven. The `lib/`
directory contains the JAR files that contains the core of Maven.

NOTE: Unless you are working in a shared Unix environment, you should
avoid customizing the `settings.xml` in `conf`. Altering the
global `settings.xml` file in the Maven installation itself is usually
unnecessary and it tends to complicate the upgrade procedure for Maven
as you'll have to remember to copy the customized `settings.xml` from
the old Maven installation to the new installation. If you need to
customize `settings.xml`, you should be editing your own
`settings.xml` in `~/.m2/settings.xml`.

[[installation-sect-user]]
==== User-Specific Configuration and Repository

Once you start using Maven extensively, you'll notice that Maven has
created some local user-specific configuration files and a local
repository in your home directory. In `~/.m2` there will be:

~/.m2/settings.xml::

   A file containing user-specific configuration for authentication,
   repositories, and other information to customize the behavior of
   Maven.

~/.m2/repository/::

   This directory contains your local Maven repository. When you
   download a dependency from a remote Maven repository, Maven stores
   a copy of the dependency in your local repository.

NOTE: In Unix (and OS X), your home directory will be referred to using
a tilde (i.e. `~/bin` refers to `/home/tobrien/bin`). In Windows, we
will also be using `~` to refer to your home directory. In Windows XP,
your home directory is `C:\Documents and Settings\tobrien`, and in
Windows Vista, your home directory is `C:\Users\tobrien`. From this
point forward, you should translate paths such as `~/m2` to your
operating system's equivalent.

[[installation-sect-upgrade]]
==== Upgrading a Maven Installation

If you've installed Maven on a Mac OS X or Unix machine according to
the details in <<installation-sect-maven-nix>>, it should be easy to upgrade to
newer versions of Maven when they become available. Simply install the
newer version of Maven ('/usr/local/maven-3.future') next to the
existing version of Maven ('/usr/local/maven-3.0.3'). Then switch the
symbolic link `/usr/local/maven` from `/usr/local/maven-3.0.3` to
`/usr/local/maven-3.future`. Since you've already set your +PATH+
variable to point to `/usr/local/maven`, you won't need to change any
environment variables.

If you have installed Maven on a Windows machine, simply unpack Maven
to `C:\Program Files\maven-3.future` and update your +PATH+
variable.

NOTE: If you have any customizations to the global `settings.xml` in
`conf`, you will need to copy this `settings.xml` to the
`conf` directory of the new Maven installation.

[[installation-sect-uninstalling]]
=== Uninstalling Maven

Most of the installation instructions involve unpacking of the Maven
distribution archive in a directory and setting of various environment
variables. If you need to remove Maven from your computer, all you
need to do is delete your Maven installation directory and remove the
environment variables. You will also want to delete the `~/.m2`
directory as it contains your local repository.

[[installation-sect-getting-help]]
=== Getting Help with Maven

While this book aims to be a comprehensive reference, there are going
to be topics we will miss and special situations and tips which are
not covered. While the core of Maven is very simple, the real work in
Maven happens in the plugins, and there are too many plugins available
to cover them all in one book. You are going to encounter problems and
features which have not been covered in this book; in these cases, we
suggest searching for answers at the following locations:

http://maven.apache.org[http://maven.apache.org]::

   This will be the first place to look. The Maven web site contains a
   wealth of information and documentation. Every plugin has a few
   pages of documentation and there is a series of "quick start"
   documents which will be helpful in addition to the content of this
   book. While the Maven site contains a wealth of information, it can
   also be frustrating, confusing, and overwhelming. There is a
   custom Google search box on the main Maven page that will search
   known Maven sites for information. This provides better results
   than a generic Google search.

Maven User Mailing List::

   The Maven User mailing list is the place for users to ask
   questions. Before you ask a question on the user mailing list, you
   will want to search for any previous discussion that might relate
   to your question. It is bad form to ask a question that has already
   been asked without first checking to see if an answer already
   exists in the archives. There are a number of useful mailing list
   archive browsers; we've found Nabble to the be the most useful. You
   can browse the User mailing list archives at
   http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-users/[http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-users/]. You
   can join the user mailing list by following the instructions
   available at
   http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html[http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html].

http://books.sonatype.com[http://books.sonatype.com]::

   Sonatype maintains an online copy of this book and other tutorials
   related to Apache Maven.
