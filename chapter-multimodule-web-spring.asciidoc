== Multi-module Enterprise Project

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

In this chapter, we create a multi-module project that evolves the
examples from <<multimodule>> and <<web>> into a project that uses the
Spring Framework and Hibernate to create both a simple web application
and a command-line utility to read data from the Yahoo! Weather
feed. The +simple-weather+ code developed in <<customizing>> will be
combined with the +simple-webapp+ project defined in <<web>>. In the
process of creating this multi-module project, we'll explore Maven and
discuss the different ways it can be used to create modular projects
that encourage reuse.

==== Downloading this Chapter's Example

The multi-module project developed in this example consists of
modified versions of the projects developed in <<customizing>> and
<<web>>, and we are not using the Maven Archetype plug-in to generate
this multi-module project. We strongly recommend downloading a copy of
the example code to use as a supplemental reference while reading the
content in this chapter. Without the examples, you won't be able to
recreate this chapter's example code. This chapter's example project
may be downloaded with the book's example code at:

Unzip this archive in any directory, and then go to the
`ch-multi-spring` directory. There you will see a directory named
`simple-parent` that contains the multi-module Maven project
developed in this chapter. In the `simple-parent/` project directory
you will see a `pom.xml` and the five submodule directories
`simple-model/`, `simple-persist/`, `simple-command/`,
`simple-weather/` and `simple-webapp/`.

==== Multi-module Enterprise Project

Presenting the complexity of a massive Enterprise-level project far
exceeds the scope of this book. Such projects are characterized by
multiple databases, integration with external systems, and subprojects
which may be divided by departments. These projects usually span
thousands of lines of code, and involve the effort of tens or hundreds
of software developers. While such a complete example is outside the
scope of this book, we can provide you with a sample project that
suggests the complexity of a larger Enterprise application. In the
conclusion we suggest some possibilities for modularity beyond that
presented in this chapter.

In this chapter, we're going to look at a multi-module Maven project
that will produce two applications: a command-line query tool for the
Yahoo! Weather feed and a web application which queries the Yahoo!
Weather feed. Both of these applications will store the results of
queries in an embedded database. Each will allow the user to retrieve
historical weather data from this embedded database. Both applications
will reuse application logic and share a persistence library. This
chapter's example builds upon the Yahoo! Weather parsing code
introduced in <<customizing>>. This project is divided into five
submodules shown in <<fig-multimodule-web-spring-projects>>.

[[fig-multimodule-web-spring-projects]]
.Multi-module Enterprise Application Module Relationships
image::figs/web/multimodule-web-spring_projects.png[]

In <<fig-multimodule-web-spring-projects>>, you can see that there are
five submodules of simple-parent, they are:

simple-model::

   This module defines a simple object model which models the data
   returned from the Yahoo! Weather feed. This object model contains
   the +Weather+, +Condition+, +Atmosphere+, +Location+, and +Wind+
   objects. When our application parses the Yahoo! Weather feed, the
   parsers defined in +simple-weather+ will parse the XML and create
   +Weather+ objects which are then used by the application. This
   project contains model objects annotated with Hibernate 3
   Annotations. These annotations are used by the logic in
   +simple-persist+ to map each model object to a corresponding table
   in a relational database.

simple-weather::

   This module contains all of the logic required to retrieve data
   from the Yahoo! Weather feed and parse the resulting XML. The XML
   returned from this feed is converted into the model objects defined
   in +simple-model+. +simple-weather+ has a dependency on
   +simple-model+. +simple-weather+ defines a +WeatherService+ object
   which is referenced by both the +simple-command+ and
   +simple-webapp+ projects.

simple-persist::

   This module contains some Data Access Objects (DAO) which are
   configured to store +Weather+ objects in an embedded database. Both
   of the applications defined in this multi-module project will use
   the DAOs defined in +simple-persist+ to store data in an embedded
   database. The DAOs defined in this project understand and return
   the model objects defined in +simple-model+. +simple-persist+ has a
   direct dependency on +simple-model+ and it depends upon the
   Hibernate Annotations present on the model objects.

simple-webapp::

   The web application project contains two Spring MVC Controller
   implementations which use the +WeatherService+ defined in
   +simple-weather+ and the DAOs defined in
   +simple-persist+. +simple-webapp+ has a direct dependency on
   +simple-weather+ and +simple-persist+; it has a transitive
   dependency on +simple-model+.

simple-command::

   This module contains a simple command-line tool which can be used
   to query the Yahoo! Weather feed. This project contains a class
   with a static +main()+ function and interacts with the
   +WeatherService+ defined in +simple-weather+ and the DAOs defined
   in +simple-persist+. +simple-command+ has a direct dependency on
   +simple-weather+ and +simple-persist+; is has a transitive
   dependency on +simple-model+.

This chapter contains a contrived example simple enough to introduce
in a book, yet complex enough to justify a set of five submodules. Our
contrived example has a model project with five classes, a persistence
library with two service classes, and a weather parsing library with
five or six classes, but a real-world system might have a model
project with a hundred objects, several persistence libraries, and
service libraries spanning multiple departments. Although we've tried
to make sure that the code contained in this example is
straightforward enough to comprehend in a single sitting, we've also
gone out of our way to build a modular project. You might be tempted
to look at the examples in this chapter and walk away with the idea
that Maven encourages too much complexity given that our model project
has only five classes. Although using Maven does suggest a certain
level of modularity, do realize that we've gone out of our way to
complicate our simple example projects for the purpose of
demonstrating Maven's multi-module features.

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-example-tech]]
==== Technology Used in this Example

This chapter's example involves some technology which, while popular,
is not directly related to Maven. These technologies are the Spring
Framework and Hibernate. The Spring Framework is an Inversion of
Control (IoC) container and a set of frameworks that aim to simplify
interaction with various J2EE libraries. Using the Spring Framework as
a foundational framework for application development gives you access
to a number of helpful abstractions that can take much of the
meddlesome busywork out of dealing with persistence frameworks like
Hibernate or iBatis or enterprise APIs like JDBC, JNDI, and JMS. The
Spring Framework has grown in popularity over the past few years as a
replacement for the heavy weight enterprise standards coming out of
Sun Microsystems. Hibernate is a widely used Object-Relational Mapping
framework which allows you to interact with a relational database as
if it were a collection of Java objects. This example focuses on
building a simple web application and a command-line application that
uses the Spring Framework to expose a set of reusable components to
applications and which also uses Hibernate to persist weather data in
an embedded database.

We've decided to include references to these frameworks to demonstrate
how one would construct projects using these technologies when using
Maven. Although we make brief efforts to introduce these technologies
throughout this chapter, we will not go out of our way to fully
explain these technologies. For more information about the Spring
Framework, please see the project's web site at
http://www.springframework.org/[http://www.springsource.org/documentation]. For
more information about Hibernate and Hibernate Annotations, please see
the project's web site at
http://www.hibernate.org[http://www.hibernate.org]. This chapter uses
Hyper Structured Query Language Database (HSQLDB) as an embedded
database; for more information about this database, see the project's
web site at http://hsqldb.org/[http://hsqldb.org].

=== The Simple Parent Project

This +simple-parent+ project has a `pom.xml` that references five
submodules: +simple-command+, +simple-model+, +simple-weather+,
+simple-persist+, and +simple-webapp+. The top-level `pom.xml` is
shown in <<ex-multimodule-web-spring-parent>>.

NOTE: If you are already familiar with Maven POMs, you might notice
that this top-level POM does not define a dependencyManagement
element. The dependencyManagement element allows you to define
dependency versions in a single, top-level POM, and it is introduced
in <<optimizing>>.

Note the similarities of this parent POM to the parent POM defined in
<<ex-multimodule-parent-pom>>. The only real difference between these
two POMs is the list of submodules. Where that example only listed two
submodules, this parent POM lists five submodules. The next few
sections explore each of these five submodules in some detail. Because
our example uses Java annotations, we've configured the compiler to
target the Java 5 JVM.

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-simple-model-project]]
=== The Simple Model Module

The first thing most enterprise projects need is an object model. An
object model captures the core set of domain objects in any system. A
banking system might have an object model which consists of an
+Account+, +Customer+, and +Transaction+ object, or a system to
capture and communicate sports scores might have a +Team+ and a +Game+
object. Whatever it is, there's a good chance that you've modeled the
concepts in your system in an object model. It is a common practice in
Maven projects to separate this project into a separate project which
is widely referenced. In this system we are capturing each query to
the Yahoo! Weather feed with a +Weather+ object which references four
other objects. Wind direction, chill, and speed are stored in a +Wind+
object. Location data including the zip code, city, region, and
country are stored in a +Location+ class. Atmospheric conditions such
as the humidity, maximum visibility, barometric pressure, and whether
the pressure is rising or falling is stored in an +Atmosphere+
class. A textual description of conditions, the temperature, and the
date of the observation is stored in a +Condition+ class.

.Simple Object Model for Weather Data
image::figs/web/multimodule-web-spring_object-model.png[]

The `pom.xml` file for this simple model object contains one
dependency that bears some explanation. Our object model is annotated
with Hibernate Annotations. We use these annotations to map the model
objects in this model to tables in a relational database. The
dependency is +org.hibernate:hibernate-annotations:3.3.0.ga+. Take a
look at the `pom.xml` shown in <<example_simple-model_pom.xml>>, and
then look at the next few examples for some illustrations of these
annotations.

In `src/main/java/org/sonatype/mavenbook/weather/model`, we have
`Weather.java`, which contains the annotated +Weather+ model
object. The +Weather+ object is a simple Java bean. This means that we
have private member variables like +id+, +location+, +condition+,
+wind+, +atmosphere+, and +date+ exposed with public getter and setter
methods that adhere to the following pattern: if a property is named
+name+, there will be a public no-arg getter method named +getName()+,
and there will be a one-argument <phrase>setter named <methodname
role="keep-together">setName(String name)+. Although we show the
getter and setter method for the +id+ property, we've omitted most of
the getters and setters for most of the other properties to save a few
trees. See <<example_weather_model_object>>.

  public Weather() {}

  public void setId(Integer id) { this.id = id; }

}
----

In the +Weather+ class, we are using Hibernate annotations to provide
guidance to the +simple-persist+ project. These annotations are used
by Hibernate to map an object to a table in a relational
database. Although a full explanation of Hibernate annotations is
beyond the scope of this chapter, here is a brief explanation for the
curious. The +@Entity+ annotation marks this class as a persistent
entity. We've omitted the +@Table+ annotation on this class, so
Hibernate is going to use the name of the class as the name of the
table to map +Weather+ to. The +@NamedQueries+ annotation defines a
query that is used by the +WeatherDAO+ in +simple-persist+. The query
language in the +@NamedQuery+ annotation is written in something
called Hibernate Query Language (HQL). Each member variable is
annotated with annotations that define the type of column and any
relationships implied by that column:

+Id+::

   The +id+ property is annotated with +@Id+. This marks the +id+
   property as the property that contains the primary key in a
   database table. The +@GeneratedValue+ controls how new primary key
   values are generated. In the case of +id+, we're using the
   +IDENTITY+ +GenerationType+, which will use the underlying
   database's identity generation facilities.

+Location+::

   Each +Weather+ object instance corresponds to a +Location+
   object. A +Location+ object represents a zip code, and the
   +@ManyToOne+ makes sure that +Weather+ objects that point to the
   same +Location+ object reference the same instance. The +cascade+
   attribute of the +@ManyToOne+ makes sure that we persist a
   +Location+ object every time we persist a +Weather+ object.

+Condition+, +Wind+, +Atmosphere+::

   Each of these objects is mapped as a +@OneToOne+ with the
   +CascadeType+ of +ALL+. This means that every time we save a
   +Weather+ object, we'll be inserting a row into the +Weather+
   table, the +Condition+ table, the +Wind+ table, and the
   +Atmosphere+ table.

+Date+::

   +Date+ is not annotated. This means that Hibernate is going to use
   all of the column defaults to define this mapping. The column name
   is going to be +date+, and the column type is going to be the
   appropriate time to match the +Date+ object.

NOTE: If you have a property you wish to omit from a table mapping,
you would annotate that property with +@Transient+.

Next, take a look at one of the secondary model objects, +Condition+,
shown in <<example_condition_model_object>>. This class also resides
in `src/main/java/org/sonatype/mavenbook/weather/model`.

[[example_condition_model_object]]
.simple-model's Condition Model Object.
----
package org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.model;

import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class Condition {

  @Id 
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Integer id;

  private String text;
  private String code;
  private String temp;
  private String date;

  @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
  @JoinColumn(name="weather_id", nullable=false)
  private Weather weather;

  public Condition() {}

  public Integer getId() { return id; }
  public void setId(Integer id) { this.id = id; }

  // All getter and setter methods omitted...
}
----

The +Condition+ class resembles the +Weather+ class. It is annotated
as an +@Entity+, and it has similar annotations on the +id+
property. The +text+, +code+, +temp+, and +date+ properties are all
left with the default column settings, and the +weather+ property is
annotated with a +@OneToOne+ annotation and another annotation that
references the associated +Weather+ object with a foreign key column
named +weather_id+.

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-simple-weather]]
=== The Simple Weather Module

The next module we're going to examine could be considered something
of a “service.” The Simple Weather module is the module that contains
all of the logic necessary to retrieve and parse the data from the
Yahoo! Weather RSS feed. Although Simple Weather contains three Java
classes and one JUnit test, it is going to present a single component,
+WeatherService+, to both the Simple Web Application and the Simple
Command-line Utility. Very often an enterprise project will contain
several API modules that contain critical business logic or logic that
interacts with external systems. A banking system might have a module
that retrieves and parses data from a third-party data provider, and a
system to display sports scores might interact with an XML feed that
presents real-time scores for basketball or soccer. In
<<example_simple-weather_module_pom>>, this module encapsulates all of
the network activity and XML parsing that is involved in the
interaction with Yahoo! Weather. Other modules can depend on this
module and simply call out to the <methodname
role="keep-together">retrieveForecast()+ method on +WeatherService+,
which takes a zip code as an argument and which returns a +Weather+
object.

            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
----

The +simple-weather+ POM extends the +simple-parent+ POM, sets the
packaging to +jar+, and then adds the following dependencies:

+org.sonatype.mavenbook.multispring:simple-model:1.0+::

   +simple-weather+ parses the Yahoo! Weather RSS feed into a
   +Weather+ object. It has a direct dependency on +simple-model+.

+log4j:log4j:1.2.14+::

   +simple-weather+ uses the Log4J library to print log messages.

+dom4j:dom4j:1.6.1 and jaxen:jaxen:1.1.1+::

   Both of these dependencies are used to parse the XML returned from
   Yahoo! Weather.

+org.apache.commons:commons-io:1.3.2 (scope=test)+::

   This +test+-scoped dependency is used by the +YahooParserTest+.

Next is the +WeatherService+ class, shown in
<<example_weatherservice_class>>. This class is going to look very
similar to the +WeatherService+ class from
<<multimodule-weather-service>>. Although the +WeatherService+ is the
same, there are some subtle differences in this chapter's
example. This version's +retrieveForecast()+ method returns a
+Weather+ object, and the formatting is going to be left to the
applications that call +WeatherService+. The other major change is
that the +YahooRetriever+ and +YahooParser+ are both bean properties
of the +WeatherService+ bean.

[[example_weatherservice_class]]
.WeatherService Class
----
package org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather;

import java.io.InputStream;

import org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.model.Weather;

public class WeatherService {

    private YahooRetriever yahooRetriever;
    private YahooParser yahooParser;

    public WeatherService() {
    }

    public Weather retrieveForecast(String zip) throws Exception {
        // Retrieve Data 
        InputStream dataIn = yahooRetriever.retrieve(zip);

        // Parse DataS   
        Weather weather = yahooParser.parse(zip, dataIn);

        return weather;
    }

    public YahooRetriever getYahooRetriever() {
        return yahooRetriever;
    }

    public void setYahooRetriever(YahooRetriever yahooRetriever) {
        this.yahooRetriever = yahooRetriever;
    }

    public YahooParser getYahooParser() {
        return yahooParser;
    }

    public void setYahooParser(YahooParser yahooParser) {
        this.yahooParser = yahooParser;
    }

}
----

Finally, in this project we have an XML file that is used by the
Spring Framework to create something called an
+ApplicationContext+. First, some explanation: both of our
applications, the web application and the command-line utility, need
to interact with the +WeatherService+ class, and they both do so by
retrieving an instance of this class from a Spring
+ApplicationContext+ using the name +weatherService+. Our web
application uses a Spring MVC controller that is associated with an
instance of +WeatherService+, and our command-line utility loads the
+WeatherService+ from an +ApplicationContext+ in a static +main()+
function. To encourage reuse, we've included an
`applicationContext-weather.xml` file in `src/main/resources`, which
is available on the classpath. Modules that depend on the
+simple-weather+ module can load this application context using the
+ClasspathXmlApplicationContext+ in the Spring Framework. They can
then reference a named instance of the +WeatherService+ named
+weatherService+.

This document defines three beans: +yahooParser+, +yahooRetriever+,
and +weatherService+. The +weatherService+ bean is an instance of
+WeatherService+, and this XML document populates the +yahooParser+
and +yahooRetriever+ properties with references to the named instances
of the corresponding classes. Think of this
`applicationContext-weather.xml` file as defining the architecture of
a subsystem in this multi-module project. Projects like
+simple-webapp+ and +simple-command+ can reference this context and
retrieve an instance of +WeatherService+ which already has
relationships to instances of +YahooRetriever+ and +YahooParser+.

=== The Simple Persist Module

This module defines two very simple Data Access Objects (DAOs). A DAO
is an object that provides an interface for persistence operations. In
an application that makes use of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
framework such as Hibernate, DAOs are usually defined around
objects. In this project, we are defining two DAO objects:
+WeatherDAO+ and +LocationDAO+. The +WeatherDAO+ class allows us to
save a +Weather+ object to a database and retrieve a +Weather+ object
by +id+, and to retrieve +Weather+ objects that match a specific
+Location+. The +LocationDAO+ has a method that allows us to retrieve
a +Location+ object by zip code. First, let's take a look at the
+simple-persist+ POM in <<ex-simple-persist-POM>>.

This POM file references +simple-parent+ as a parent POM, and it
defines a few dependencies. The dependencies listed in
+simple-persist+'s POM are:

+org.sonatype.mavenbook.multispring:simple-model:1.0+::

   Just like the +simple-weather+ module, this persistence module
   references the core model objects defined in +simple-model+.

+org.hibernate:hibernate:3.2.5.ga+::

   We define a dependency on Hibernate version 3.2.5.ga, but notice
   that we're excluding a dependency of Hibernate. We're doing this
   because the +javax.++transaction:++jta+ dependency is not available
   in the public Maven repository. This dependency happens to be one
   of those Sun dependencies that has not yet made it into the free
   central Maven repository. To avoid an annoying message telling us
   to go download these nonfree dependencies, we simply exclude this
   dependency from Hibernate.

+javax.servlet:servlet-api:2.4+::

   Since this project contains a Servlet, we need to include the
   Servlet API version 2.4.

+org.springframework:spring:2.0.7+::

   This includes the entire Spring Framework as a dependency.  It is
   generally a good practice to depend on only the components of
   Spring you happen to be using. The Spring Framework project has
   been nice enough to create focused artifacts such as
   +spring-hibernate3+.

Why depend on Spring? When it comes to Hibernate integration, Spring
allows us to leverage helper classes such as
+HibernateDaoSupport+. For an example of what is possible with the
help of +HibernateDaoSupport+, take a look at the code for the
+WeatherDAO+ in <<ex-persist-weatherdao-class>>.

[[ex-persist-weatherdao-class]]
.simple-persist's WeatherDAO Class
----
package org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.persist;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import org.hibernate.Query;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateCallback;
import org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.support.HibernateDaoSupport;

import org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.model.Location;
import org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.model.Weather;

public class WeatherDAO extends HibernateDaoSupport { <1>

  public WeatherDAO() {}

  public void save(Weather weather) { <2>
    getHibernateTemplate().save( weather );
  }

  public Weather load(Integer id) { <3>
    return (Weather) getHibernateTemplate().load( Weather.class, id);
  }

  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public List<Weather> recentForLocation( final Location location ) {
    return (List<Weather>) getHibernateTemplate().execute(
        new HibernateCallback() { <4>
          public Object doInHibernate(Session session) {
              Query query = 
                getSession().getNamedQuery("Weather.byLocation");
              query.setParameter("location", location);
              return new ArrayList<Weather>( query.list() );
        }
    });
  }
}
----

That's it. No really, you are done writing a class that can insert new
rows, select by primary key, and find all rows in Weather that join to
an id in the Location table. Clearly, we can't stop this book and
insert the five hundred pages it would take to get you up to speed on
the intricacies of Hibernate, but we can do some very quick
explanation:

<1> This class extends +HibernateDaoSupport+. What this means is that
the class is going to be associated with a Hibernate +SessionFactory+
which it is going to use to create Hibernate +Session+ objects. In
Hibernate, every operation goes through a +Session+ object, a
+Session+ mediates access to the underlying database and takes care of
managing the connection to the JDBC +DataSource+. Extending
+HibernateDaoSupport+ also means that we can access the
+HibernateTemplate+ using +getHibernateTemplate()+. For an example of
what can be done with the +HibernateTemplate+...

<2> The +save()+ method takes an instance of +Weather+ and calls the
+save()+ method on a +HibernateTemplate+. The +HibernateTemplate+
simplifies calls to common Hibernate operations and converts any
database specific exceptions to runtime exceptions. Here we call out
to +save()+ which inserts a new record into the +Weather+
table. Alternatives to +save()+ are +update()+ which updates an
existing row, or +saveOrUpdate()+ which would either save or update
depending on the presence of a non-null +id+ property in Weather.

<3> The +load()+ method, once again, is a one-liner that just calls a
method on an instance of +HibernateTemplate+. +load()+ on
+HibernateTemplate+ takes a +Class+ object and a +Serializable+
object. In this case, the +Serializable+ corresponds to the +id+ value
of the +Weather+ object to load.

<4> This last method +recentForLocation()+ calls out to a +NamedQuery+
defined in the +Weather+ model object. If you can think back that far,
the +Weather+ model object defined a named query
+"Weather.byLocation"+ with a query of +"from Weather w where
w.location = :location"+. We're loading this +NamedQuery+ using a
reference to a Hibernate +Session+ object inside a +HibernateCallback+
which is executed by the +execute()+ method on
+HibernateTemplate+. You can see in this method that we're populating
the named parameter location with the parameter passed in to the
+recentForLocation()+ method.

Now is a good time for some clarification. +HibernateDaoSupport+ and
+HibernateTemplate+ are classes from the Spring Framework. They were
created by the Spring Framework to make writing Hibernate DAO objects
painless. To support this DAO, we'll need to do some configuration in
the +simple-persist+ Spring +ApplicationContext+ definition. The XML
document shown in <<ex-persist-spring>> is stored in
`src/main/resources` in a file named `applicationContext-persist.xml`.

----

In this application context, we're accomplishing a few things. The
+sessionFactory+ bean is the bean from which the DAOs retrieve
Hibernate +Session+ objects. This bean is an instance of
+AnnotationSessionFactoryBean+ and is supplied with a list of
+annotatedClasses+. Note that the list of annotated classes is the
list of classes defined in our +simple-model+ module. Next, the
+sessionFactory+ is configured with a set of Hibernate configuration
properties (+hibernateProperties+). In this example, our Hibernate
properties define a number of settings:

+hibernate.dialect+::

   This setting controls how SQL is to be generated for our
   database. Since we are using the HSQLDB database, our database
   dialect is set to
   +org.++hibernate.++dialect.++HSQLDialect+. Hibernate has dialects
   for all major databases such as Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, and SQL
   Server.

+hibernate.connection.*+::

   In this example, we're configuring the JDBC connection properties
   from the Spring configuration. Our applications are configured to
   run against a HSQLDB in the`./data/weather` directory. In a real
   enterprise application, it is more likely you would use something
   like JNDI to externalize database configuration from your
   application's code.

Lastly, in this bean definition file, both of the +simple-persist+ DAO
objects are created and given a reference to the +sessionFactory+ bean
just defined. Just like the Spring application context in
+simple-weather+, this `applicationContext-persist.xml` file defines
the architecture of a submodule in a larger enterprise design. If you
were working with a larger collection of persistence classes, you
might find it useful to capture them in an application context which
is separate from your application.

There's one last piece of the puzzle in +simple-persist+. Later in
this chapter, we're going to `hibernate.cfg.xml` in
`src/main/resources`. The purpose of this file (which duplicates some
of the configuration in `applicationContext-persist.xml`) is to allow
us to leverage the Maven Hibernate3 plugin to generate Data Definition
Language (DDL) from nothing more than our annotations. See
<<ex-hibernate-cfg>>.

The contents of <<ex-persist-spring>> and
<<ex-multimodule-web-spring-parent>> are redundant. While the Spring
Application Context XML is going to be used by the web application and
the command-line application, the `hibernate.cfg.xml` exists only to
support the Maven Hibernate3 plugin. Later in this chapter, we'll see
how to use this `hibernate.cfg.xml` and the Maven Hibernate3 plugin to
generate a database schema based on the annotated object model defined
in +simple-model+. This `hibernate.cfg.xml` file is the file that will
configure the JDBC connection properties and enumerate the list of
annotated model classes for the Maven Hibernate3 plugin.

=== The Simple Web Application Module

The web application is defined in a +simple-webapp+ project. This
simple web application project is going to define two Spring MVC
Controllers: +WeatherController+ and +simple-weather+ and the
`applicationContext-persist.xml` file in +simple-persist+. The
component architecture of this simple web application is shown in

----

As this book progresses and the examples become more and more
substantial, you'll notice that the `pom.xml` begins to take on some
weight. In this POM, we're configuring four dependencies and two
plugins. Let's go through this POM in detail and dwell on some of the
important configuration points:

<1> This +simple-webapp+ project defines four dependencies: the
Servlet 2.4 specification, the simple-weather service library, the
simple-persist persistence library, and the entire Spring Framework
2.0.7.

<2> The Maven Jetty plugin couldn't be easier to add to this project;
we simply add a +plugin+ element that references the appropriate
+groupId+ and +artifactId+. The fact that this plugin is so trivial to
configure means that the plugin developers did a good job of providing
adequate defaults that don't need to be overridden in most cases. If
you did need to override the configuration of the Jetty plugin, you
would do so by providing a +configuration+ element.

<3> In our build configuration, we're going to be configuring the
Maven Hibernate3 Plugin to hit an embedded HSQLDB instance. For the
Maven Hibernate 3 plugin to successfully connect to this database
using JDBC, the plugin will need reference the HSQLDB JDBC driver on
the classpath. To make a dependency available for a plugin, we add a
dependency declaration right inside plugin declaration. In this case,
we're referencing hsqldb:hsqldb:1.8.0.7. The Hibernate plugin also
needs the JDBC driver to create the database, so we have also added
this dependency to its configuration.

<4> The Maven Hibernate plugin is when this POM starts to get
interesting. In the next section, we're going to run the +hbm2ddl+
goal to generate a HSQLDB database. In this `pom.xml`, we're including
a reference to version 2.0 of the +hibernate3-maven-plugin+ hosted by
the Codehaus Mojo plugin.

<5> The Maven Hibernate3 plugin has different ways to obtain Hibernate
mapping information that are appropriate for different usage scenarios
of the Hibernate3 plugin. If you were using Hibernate Mapping XML
(`.hbm.xml`) files, and you wanted to generate model classes using the
+hbm2java+ goal, you would set your implementation to
configuration. If you were using the Hibernate3 plugin to reverse
engineer a database to produce `.hbm.xml` files and model classes from
an existing database, you would use an implementation of
+jdbcconfiguration+. In this case, we're simply using an existing
annotated object model to generate a database. In other words, we have
our Hibernate mapping, but we don't yet have a database. In this usage
scenario, the appropriate implementation value is
+annotationconfiguration+. The Maven Hibernate3 plugin is discussed in
more detail in the later section
<<multimodule-web-spring-sect-spring-running-web>>.

Next, we turn our attention to the two Spring MVC controllers that
will handle all of the requests. Both of these controllers reference
the beans defined in +simple-weather+ and +simple-persist+.

.simple-webapp WeatherController
----
package org.sonatype.mavenbook.web;

import org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.model.Weather;
import org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.persist.WeatherDAO;
import org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.WeatherService;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.Controller;

public class WeatherController implements Controller {

  private WeatherService weatherService;
  private WeatherDAO weatherDAO;

  public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request,
                                    HttpServletResponse response) 
                                  throws Exception {

    String zip = request.getParameter("zip");
    Weather weather = weatherService.retrieveForecast(zip);
    weatherDAO.save(weather);
    return new ModelAndView("weather", "weather", weather);
  }

  public WeatherService getWeatherService() {
    return weatherService;
  }

  public void setWeatherService(WeatherService weatherService) {
    this.weatherService = weatherService;
  }

  public WeatherDAO getWeatherDAO() {
    return weatherDAO;
  }

  public void setWeatherDAO(WeatherDAO weatherDAO) {
    this.weatherDAO = weatherDAO;
  }
}
----

+WeatherController+ implements the Spring MVC Controller interface
that mandates the presence of a +handleRequest()+ method with the
signature shown in the example. If you look at the meat of this
method, you'll see that it invokes the +retrieveForecast()+ method on
the +weatherService+ instance variable. Unlike the previous chapter,
which had a Servlet that instantiated the +WeatherService+ class, the
+WeatherController+ is a bean with a +weatherService+ property. The
Spring IoC container is responsible for wiring the controller to the
+weatherService+ component. Also notice that we're not using the
+WeatherFormatter+ in this Spring controller implementation; instead,
we're passing the +Weather+ object returned by +retrieveForecast()+ to
the constructor of +ModelAndView+. This +ModelAndView+ class is going
to be used to render a Velocity template, and this template will have
references to a `${weather}` variable. The `weather.vm` template
is stored in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/vm` and is shown in
<<ex-weather-vm>>.

In the +WeatherController+, before we render the output of the
forecast, we pass the +Weather+ object returned by the
+WeatherService+ to the +save()+ method on +WeatherDAO+. Here we are
saving this +Weather+ object—using Hibernate—to an HSQLDB
database. Later, in +HistoryController+, we will see how we can
retrieve a history of weather forecasts that were saved by the
+WeatherController+.

The syntax for this Velocity template is straightforward: variables
are referenced using `${}` notation. The expression between the
curly braces references a property, or a property of a property on the
+weather+ variable, which was passed to this template by the
+WeatherController+.

The +HistoryController+ is used to retrieve recent forecasts that have
been requested by the +WeatherController+. Whenever we retrieve a
forecast from the +WeatherController+, that controller saves the
+Weather+ object to the database via the +WeatherDAO+. +WeatherDAO+
then uses Hibernate to dissect the +Weather+ object into a series of
rows in a set of related database tables. The +HistoryController+ is
shown in <<ex-spring-history>>.

The +HistoryController+ is wired to two DAO objects defined in
+simple-persist+. The DAOs are bean properties of the
+HistoryController+: +WeatherDAO+ and +LocationDAO+. The goal of the
+HistoryController+ is to retrieve a +List+ of +Weather+ objects which
correspond to the +zip+ parameter. When the +WeatherDAO+ saves the
+Weather+ object to the database, it doesn't just store the zip code,
it stores a +Location+ object which is related to the +Weather+ object
in the +simple-model+. To retrieve a +List+ of +Weather+ objects, the
+HistoryController+ first retrieves the +Location+ object that
corresponds to the +zip+ parameter. It does this by invoking the
+findByZip()+ method on +LocationDAO+.

Once the +Location+ object has been retrieved, the +HistoryController+
will then attempt to retrieve recent +Weather+ objects that match the
given +Location+. Once the +List<Weather>+ has been retrieved, a
+HashMap+ is created to hold two variables for the `history.vm`
Velocity template shown in <<ex-spring-history-velocity>>.

The `history.vm` template in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/vm` references
the +location+ variable to print out information about the location of
the forecasts retrieved from the +WeatherDAO+. This template then uses
a Velocity control structure, +#foreach+, to loop through each element
in the +weathers+ variable. Each element in +weathers+ is assigned to
a variable named +weather+ and the template between +#foreach+ and
+#end+ is rendered for each forecast.

You've seen these +Controller+ implementations, and you've seen that
they reference other beans defined in +simple-weather+ and
+simple-persist+, they respond to HTTP requests, and they yield
control to some mysterious templating system that knows how to render
Velocity templates. All of this magic is configured in a Spring
application context in
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weather-servlet.xml`. This XML configures the
controllers and references other Spring-managed beans, it is loaded by
a +ServletContextListener+ which is also configured to load the
`applicationContext-weather.xml` and `applicationContext-persist.xml`
from the classpath. Let's take a closer look at the
`weather-servlet.xml` shown in <<ex-spring-weather-servlet>>.

<1> The `weather-servlet.xml` defines the two controllers as
Spring-managed beans. +weatherController+ has two properties which are
references to +weatherService+ and +weatherDAO+. +historyController+
references the beans +weatherDAO+ and +locationDAO+. When this
+ApplicationContext+ is created, it is created in an environment that
has access to the +ApplicationContext+s defined in both
+simple-persist+ and +simple-weather+. In <<ex-spring-web-xml>> you
will see how Spring is configured to merge components from multiple
Spring configuration files.

<2> The +urlMapping+ bean defines the URL patterns which invoke the
+WeatherController+ and the +HistoryController+. In this example, we
are using the +SimpleUrlHandlerMapping+ and mapping `/weather.x` to
+WeatherController+ and `/history.x` to +HistoryController+.

<3> Since we are using the Velocity templating engine, we will need to
pass in some configuration options. In the +velocityConfig+ bean, we
are telling Velocity to look for all templates in the `/WEB-INF/vm`
directory.

<4> Last, the +viewResolver+ is configured with the class
+VelocityViewResolver+. There are a number of +ViewResolver+
implementations in Spring from a standard ViewResolver to render JSP
or JSTL pages to a resolver which can render Freemarker templates. In
this example, we're configuring the Velocity templating engine and
setting the default prefix and suffix which will be automatically
appended to the names of the template passed to +ModelAndView+.

Finally, the +simple-webapp+ project was a `web.xml` which provides
the basic configuration for the web application. The `web.xml` file is
shown in <<ex-spring-web-xml>>.

----
  
<1> <calloutlist> Here's a bit of magic which allows us to reuse the
`applicationContext-weather.xml` and `applicationContext-persist.xml`
in this project. The +contextConfigLocation+ is used by the
+ContextLoaderListener+ to create an +ApplicationContext+. When the
weather servlet is created, the `weather-servlet.xml` from
<<ex-spring-weather-servlet>> is going to be evaluated with the
+ApplicationContext+ created from this +contextConfigLocation+. In
this way, you can define a set of beans in another project and you can
reference these beans via the classpath. Since the +simple-persist+
and +simple-weather+ JARs are going to be in `WEB-INF/lib`, all we do
is use the +classpath:+ prefix to reference these files. (Another
option would have been to copy these files to `/WEB-INF` and reference
them with something like `/WEB-INF/applicationContext-persist.xml`).

<2> The +log4jConfigLocation+ is used to tell the
+Log4JConfigListener+ where to look for Log4J logging
configuration. In this example, we tell Log4J to look in
`/WEB-INF/log4j.properties`.

<3> This makes sure that the Log4J system is configured when the web
application starts. It is important to put this +Log4JConfigListener+
before the+ ContextLoaderListener+; otherwise, you may miss important
logging messages which point to a problem preventing application
startup. If you have a particularly large set of beans managed by
Spring, and one of them happens to blow up on application startup,
your application will fail. If you have logging initialized before
Spring starts, you might have a chance to catch a warning or an
error. If you don't have logging initialized before Spring starts up,
you'll have no idea why your application refuses to start.

<4> The +ContextLoaderListener+ is essentially the Spring
container. When the application starts, this listener will build an
+ApplicationContext+ from the +contextConfigLocation+ parameter.

<5> We define a Spring MVC +DispatcherServlet+ with a name of
+weather+. This will cause Spring to look for a Spring configuration
file in `/WEB-INF/weather-servlet.xml`. You can have as many
+DispatcherServlet+s as you need, a +DispatcherServlet+ can contain
one or more Spring MVC +Controller+ implementations.

<6> All requests ending in `.x` will be routed to the +weather+
servlet. Note that the `.x` extension has no particular meaning, it is
an arbitrary choice and you can use whatever URL pattern you like.

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-spring-running-web]]
=== Running the Web Application

To run the web application, you'll first need to build the entire
multi-module project and then build the database using the Hibernate3
plugin. First, from the top-level `simple-parent` project directory,
run +mvn clean install+:

----
$ mvn clean install
----

Running +mvn clean install+ at the top-level of your multi-module
project will install all of modules into your local Maven
repository. You need to do this before building the database from the
+simple-webapp+ project. 

WARNING: This plugin version requires Java 6 to work. 

To build the database from the
+simple-webapp+ project, run the following from the +simple-webapp+
project's directory:

----
$ mvn hibernate3:hbm2ddl
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Searching repository for plugin with prefix: 'hibernate3'.

Once you've done this, there should be a `${basedir}/data`
directory which will contain the HSQLDB database. You can then start
the web application with:

----
$ mvn jetty:run

Once Jetty is started, you can load
http://localhost:8080/simple-webapp/weather.x?zip=60202[http://localhost:8080/simple-webapp/weather.x?zip=60202]
and you should see the weather for Evanston, IL in your web
browser. Change the ZIP code and you should be able to get your own
weather report.

The +simple-command+ project is a command-line version of the

----

The +Main+ class has a reference to +WeatherDAO+, +LocationDAO+, and
+WeatherService+. The static +main()+ method in this class:

* Reads the Zip Code from the first command line argument

* Reads the Operation from the second command line argument. If the
   operation is "weather", the latest weather will be retrieved from
   the web service. If the operation is "history", the program will
   fetch historical weather records from the local database.

* Loads a Spring +ApplicationContext+ using two XML files loaded from
   +simple-persist+ and +simple-weather+

* Creates an instance of +Main+

* Populates the +weatherService+, +weatherDAO+, and +locationDAO+ with
   beans from the Spring +ApplicationContext+

* Runs the appropriate method +getWeather()+ or +getHistory()+
   depending on the specified operation.

In the web application we use Spring +VelocityViewResolver+ to render
a Velocity template. In the stand-alone implementation, we need to
write a simple class which renders our weather data with a Velocity
template. <<ex-spring-weather-formatter>> is a listing of the
+WeatherFormatter+, a class with two methods that render the weather
report and the weather history.

The `weather.vm` template simply prints the zip code's city, country,
and region as well as the current temperature. The `history.vm`

=== Running the Simple Command

The +simple-command+ project is configured to create a single JAR
containing the bytecode of the project and all of the bytecode from
the dependencies. To create this assembly, run the +assembly+ goal of
the Maven Assembly plugin from the +simple-command+ project directory:

----
$ mvn assembly:assembly
[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Building Multi-spring Chapter Simple Command Line Tool
[INFO]task-segment: [assembly:assembly] (aggregator-style)
[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------
[INFO] [resources:resources]

[INFO] [assembly:assembly]
[INFO] Processing DependencySet (output=)
[INFO] Building jar: .../simple-parent/simple-command/target
/simple-command-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----

The build progresses through the lifecycle compiling bytecode, running
tests, and finally building a JAR for the project. Then the
+assembly:assembly+ goal creates a JAR with dependencies by unpacking
all of the dependencies to temporary directories and then collecting
all of the bytecode into a single JAR in `target/` named
`simple-command-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. This "uber" JAR weighs in
at 15 MB.

Before you run the command-line tool, you will need to invoke the
+hbm2ddl+ goal of the Hibernate3 plugin to create the HSQLDB
database. Do this by running the following command from the
+simple-command+ directory:

----
$ mvn hibernate3:hbm2ddl
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Searching repository for plugin with prefix: 'hibernate3'.
[INFO] org.codehaus.mojo: checking for updates from central
[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------

10:24:56,151  INFO org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport - export complete
[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL
[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------
----

Once you run this, you should see a `data` directory under
+simple-command+. This `data` directory holds the HSQLDB database. To
run the command-line weather forecaster, run the following from the
`simple-command` project directory:

----
$ java -cp target/simple-command-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
       org.sonatype.mavenbook.weather.Main 60202
2321 INFO  YahooRetriever  - Retrieving Weather Data

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-conclusion]]
=== Conclusion

We've spent a great deal of time on topics not directly related Maven
to get this far. We've done this to present a complete and meaningful
example project which you can use to implement real-world systems. We
didn't take any short-cuts to produce slick, canned results quickly,
and we're not going to dazzle you with some Ruby on Rails-esque
wizardry and lead you to believe that you can create a finished Java
Enterprise application in "10 easy minutes!" There's too much of this
in the market, there are too many people trying to sell you the
easiest framework that requires zero investment of time or
attention. What we're trying to do in this chapter is present the
entire picture, the entire ecosystem of a multi-module build. What
we've done is present Maven in the context of a application which
resembles something you could see in the wild—not the fast-food, 10
minute screen-cast that slings mud at Apache Ant and tries to convince
you to adopt Apache Maven.

If you walk away from this chapter wondering what it has to do with
Maven, we've succeeded. We present a complex set of projects, using
popular frameworks, and we tie them together using declarative
builds. The fact that more than 60% of this chapter was spent
explaining Spring and Hibernate should tell you that Maven, for the
most part, stepped out of the way. It worked. It allowed us to focus
on the application itself, not on the build process. Instead of
spending time discussing Maven, and the work you would have to do to
"build a build" that integrated with Spring and Hibernate, we talked
almost exclusively about the technologies used in this contrived
project. If you start to use Maven, and you take the time to learn it,
you really do start to benefit from the fact that you don't have to
spend time coding up some procedural build script. You don't have to
spend your time worrying about mundane aspects of your build.

You can use the skeleton project introduced in this chapter as the
foundation for your own, and chances are that when you do, you'll find
yourself creating more and more modules as you need them. For example,
the project on which this chapter was based has two distinct model
projects, two persistence projects which persist to dramatically
different databases, several web applications, and a Java mobile
application. In total, the real world system I based this on contains
at least 15 interrelated modules. The point is that, you've seen the
most complex multi-module example we're going to include in this book,
but you should also know that this example just scratches the surface
of what is possible with Maven.

[[multimodule-web-spring-sect-interface-projects]]
==== Programming to Interface Projects

This chapter explored a multi-module project which was more complex
than the simple example presented in <<multimodule>>, yet it was still
a simplification of a real-world project. In a larger project, you
might find yourself building a system resembling
<<fig-multimodule-web-spring-projects-complex>>.

[[fig-multimodule-web-spring-projects-complex]]
.Programming to Interface Projects
image::figs/web/multimodule-web-spring_projects-complex.png[]

When we use the term interface project we are referring to a Maven
project which contains interfaces and constants only. In
<<fig-multimodule-web-spring-projects-complex>> the interface projects
would be +persist-api+ and +parse-api+. If +big-command+ and
+big-webapp+ are written to the interfaces defined in +persist-api+,
then it is very easy to just swap in another implementation of the
persistence library. This particular diagram shows two implementations
of the +persist-api+ project, one which stores data in an XML
database, and the other which stores data in a relational database. If
you use some of the concepts in this chapter, you can see how you
could just pass in a flag to the program that swaps in a different
Spring application context XML file to swap out data sources of
persistence implementations. Just like the OO design of the
application itself, it is often wise to separate the interfaces of an
API from the implementation of the API into separate Maven projects.
