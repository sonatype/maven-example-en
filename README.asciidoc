== Maven by Example

=== About the Book

An introduction to Apache Maven as formerly published as part of the
book _Maven: The Definitive Guide_.

The book is available in HTML and PDF format at http://www.sonatype.com/resources/books/maven-by-example[http://www.sonatype.com/resources/books/maven-by-example].


=== About this Project

This is the source code and build setup for the book. The content is written in asciidoc format.  

- To edit asciidoc, use Emacs, vi, TextMate, or whatever other text editor you prefer.  
- You can even just preview the files right in GitHub and edit them on the web interface directly.
- Another way is to use a preview tool like this https://previewhub.github.io/asciidoc/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonatype/maven-example-en/master/book-mvnex.asciidoc[book-mvnex.asciidoc]

The main file for the book is

* `book-mvnex.asciidoc`

which in turn includes a whole bunch of files named 

* `chapter-*.asciidoc`

These are all you should have to edit in terms of text content.

Additional documentation for authors and contributors to this book can be found
in the `doc/` subdirectory of the project.

==== Figures and screenshots?  

Put them into `figs/orig`.

The rest is taken care of by the build.

==== Anything else? 

You'll see a lot of distracting files in that `figs/orig` directory.  For now,
you should just ignore them.  Actually, in general, you'll notice a
number of distracting files in this project.  Really, just ignore
them or contact us directly if you need something.

==== How to build the book

I knew you'd ask that, and here's the simple answer:

* Install asciidoc
* Install dblatex and the docbook xsl style sheets
* Install python
* Run `./build.sh`

Build is known to work on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. If you use something
else you might or might not end up in trouble.
